# MAP
Basically a minecraft python mining bot. 
Also put the lava1.png into a folder named Images within the same directory of the main file(Keystroke.py). Then run the script(Keystroke.py).
In Order to use:
Open minecraft java edition
go underground
run the script
choose 1
press enter
then aim the cross hair so it mines 2 blocks at once
take your hands off the keyboard
and let it go!(It detects lava so it won't die(Most likely))
